Welcome to the course page for the Neurokognitive Psychologie group of the PsyBSc 10 course: Empirisch-Experimentelles Praktikum (*ExPra*), for Winter Semester 2025!

This course is part of the [Psychologie BSc programme](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/49829433/Bachelorstudiengang?) at Goethe University Frankfurt. This site will contains all the content we will cover, and will hopefully serve as a useful reference point for the course. These pages aren't static, but will be updated as we move through the course together.

## ExPra Winter Semester 2025

A lot of the time, when learning about Psychology, we only focus on the end-product of research. The focus of the ExPra course is to gain hands-on experience with research in Psychology. Not everyone will go on to work in research settings after their degree, but a lot of the skills you will learn are very transferable. First, the course should help you evaluate and conceptualise research methods in research that you encounter in the remainder of your studies. Second, we will aim to help you develop transferable skills such as critical and scientific thinking, project management, and quantitative analyses that should be valuable whatever you end up doing after your degree.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties with the lecture and its materials, please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch with us. A great way to do this is to [open an issue on the GitHub site](https://github.com/JackEdTaylor/expra-wise25/issues/new) of the course. You can of course also contact us via Discord or email. Any feedback or ideas you might have will be appreciated!
