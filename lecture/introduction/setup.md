# Setup

There are a few things you need to get working on your machine in order to follow this course. Don't worry though! Everything will be open source, won't require a lot of storage, and will be explained in detail.


## General things

There are a few computing requirements for the course that are absolutely necessary (beyond the few software packages you should install, described below):

- You must have adminstrator access to your computer. This means you will be able to install software without seeking approval from IT.

- You must have at least 15 GB free disk space available on your computer (more is recommended, and this is only a rough estimate!).

If you foresee any of these being a problem please reach out to one of the instructors and enquire what steps you can take to ensure your setup is ready for the course.

## Required software

We ask that you install the following software before arriving to the second session:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version `4.4.1`) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

- [`Psychopy`](https://www.psychopy.org/) (Standalone installation) for running the demo experiment and your projects

- A modern browser: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) are recommended

- [Microsoft Office](https://www.rz.uni-frankfurt.de/73202101/Microsoft_Office_f%25C3%25BCr_Studierende)

- A literature & reference manager: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (recommended), or an alternative like Citavi (possible but not recommended)

- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for course-related communication

**Note**: If the instructions aren't working and you have spent more than 15-20 minutes troubleshooting on your own, reach out on the `#help-installation` channel on the Discord channel with the exact problems you're having.
One of the instructors will try and get back to you quickly to help resolve the situation.
If they're unable to help via `Discord`, you may be directed to attend one of the installation office hours.

Once this is all set up, you're ready to go!
