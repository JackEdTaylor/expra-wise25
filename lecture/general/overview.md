# Overview

In this ExPra (Empirisch-Experimentelles Praktikum), you will get hands-on experience in Psychological research. We will progress through the stages of a research project, from theoretical background and methodological understanding, to experiment design, data collection, analysis, and presentation of results in a poster, presentation, and report.

### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Everything we will use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or at minimum free of charge and publicly available. You can find details on how to set up software for the course in the [Setup](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise24/introduction/setup.html) section of this book.

### Where is everything?

All course materials (lecture slides, lecture demo notebooks, lab notebooks, homework assignments, etc.) will be available on the [course website](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise24/), i.e. the one you're looking at right now. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up for the entire duration of the course and beyond, ideally to end of the internet. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.


### Late Homework & Extension Policy

*Homework assignments* will usually have a clearly stated deadline (see [Assignments](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise24/general/assignments.html)), so as to manage course load clearly. Exceptions will be communicated.


### Academic Honor Code

We encourage you to discuss and work together with classmates on problems. However, the ExPra report must be your own, original work. Using online resources to help with programming or understanding is recommended, but any text from other written works should be put into your own words, as well as cited. If you really need to use the original text, quote the text in quotation marks, and cite the exact page in the original work. Similarly, any code copied from the internet must be clearly marked as such, with a link to the source.

Please also check the specific rules and guidelines we have developed for the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT during the ExPra: [AI Tools](https://jackedtaylor.github.io/expra-wise24/general/gen_ai.html).


### Missed work due to religious holy days

We might miss some things, so please notify the instructors of your pending absence at least 7 days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.


### Student Accommodations

- Please request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations.
- Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible.
- Please notify me if any of the physical accomodations are difficult to use or access for you.
