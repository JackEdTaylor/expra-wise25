## The ExPra Report

### What should the report look like?

The ExPra report is the final exam for the research project. The report is graded, and determines your final mark for the course.

You will write your ExPra reports individually (not as a group), reporting on the research question you investigated. Because the ExPra should be an individual assignment, **you cannot share titles, figures, tables, etc. with your group**.

ExPra report submissions must:

* Be written in English

* Be appriximately 15 pages long (excluding table of contents, appendix, but including references)

* Be formatted in size 12, double-spaced Times New Roman

* Follow APA Style (publication manual, 7th edition) if not stated otherwise

* Include an R script containing code of all analyses you carried out (this should be submitted as a separate file along with the EXPRA report and should also be uploaded to LIFOS)

* Link to your preregistrations in your LIFOS repository.

* Include a signed declaration of originality on the last page of the report (see below).

The deadline for submitting ExPra reports is 4 weeks after the final session (see above).

**Important:** You must register your EXPRA report with the examination office (*PrÃ¼fungsanmeldung via QIS*) and append a signed declaration of originality (*EigenstÃ¤ndigkeitserklÃ¤rung, for a template see [FAQs by the examination office](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/126118252/BSc_MSc_FAQ_Okt_2022.pdf)*).

### How is it graded?

````{margin}
```{warning}
Note that the grading criteria sheet is only a guide! Your grade will not be calculated as a simple sum of the scores on the grading criteria sheet.
````

The ExPra will be graded by me (Jack Taylor).

You can download the grading criteria that I will be using as a guide here: [ExPra Grading Criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackEdTaylor/expra-wise24/master/lecture/static/ExPra_grading_criteria.pdf)

### Submitting the ExPra Report

Once you are ready to submit, you should submit your ExPra report to me by email: `Taylor(at)psych.uni-frankfurt.de`. The email should be sent from your student email account. Please set the Subject line to read: "`ExPra (your matrikelnummer) Group (your group letter)`". For example, "`ExPra 7914651 Group C`".

When you send the email, please attach the following files:

1. Your ExPra report, including cover sheet and declaration of originality. Instructions and examples of what these should include can be found above.

2. An anonymised version of your ExPra report. Any sections of your report that reveal your name or identity should be removed. Usually, this will just mean removing the cover sheet and declaration of originality.

3. The R Script you wrote to implement your analyses. This should be identical to the script you shared on LIFOS.
